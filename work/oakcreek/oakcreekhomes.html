					<h1>Elevating the<br> Mobile Home Market</h1>
					<p>Oak Creek Homes is one of the nation’s premiere mobile & manufactured home builders, bringing quality, modern homes to their customers. Since its founding, Oak Creek has built a powerful reputation for stability, but their website wasn’t sending the right message.</p>
					<p>Rocksauce collaborated with the Oak Creek Homes team to hone in on the right approach to messaging, key website features, and visual design to engage their customers.</p>
					<p>We started with an extensive UX process, refining the best flow for new customers, helping them discover the right products for their growing families.</p>
					<p>Our design team then focused on modernizing the Oak Creek Homes brand, creating an elegant design, inviting design that envokes the build quality of their homes.</p>
					<p>When it came to development, we crafted a custom-iteration of their content management system, creating a modular interface, allowing Oak Creek Homes to add new pages on the fly. As new pages are are made, Oak Creek is able to choose from dozens of content styles to apply, never needing to worry about their additions breaking the design harmony we built.</p>

				<h1>Unlock the Happiness</h1>
				<p>Want us to make your app? First thing we need is your devices details. UDID, software version, how much space is left on your disk, and a dozen of of other minute details. So the question was - how do you get us this data?</p>
				<p>Every app on the market was terrible. None of them gave us the info we needed, and even worse, they looked like garbage. This doesn't make you happy.</p>
				<p>So we created MetaSauce and the world smiled.</p>

				<h1>ALL THE SECRETS YOU WANNA KNOW</h1>
				<p>There are so many secrets buried in your device that you have no idea about, and each one of them can have a profound effect on how your device performs.</p>

				<p>MetaSauce is magical, though. We dig in deep to help you discover way more than your UDID. Want to know what version of hardware you have? Got it. How about what the network details are? No problem, here you go.</p>

				<p>MetaSauce breaks down the various processes your device is currently running, while showing you how much of your drive space is currently being used.</p>

				<p>Never has a tool given you so much, for so little.<br/> You're welcome.</p>

				<h1>Of course, it's beautiful, too</h1>
				<p>You love us because we make all the pretty things, so obviously, if we're going to make a tool like MetaSauce, Rocksauce Studios is going to make sure it's gorgeous, right?</p>
				<p>Don't build something unless it's going to make a statement. This is the wisdom we impart on our clients, and it's the same driving force behind tools we create internally, as well.</p>

						<h1>v1 DESIGN</h1>
						<p>Our initial Alpha design had all of the right elements,  and laid down our navigational structure. The problem was that it felt a little too simple.</p>
						<p>We wanted to create a juxtaposition with MetaSauce: create something simple, but give it a complex beauty that our audience wouldn't expect from a UDID app.</p>

						<h1>v2 DESIGN</h1>
						<p>Since our layout was solid and to the point, that didn't need any changing, but we wanted to make the app's iconography fell more in line with the Rocksauce Studios branding, which people had come to love.</p>
						<p>We brought the iconography and colors to be in line with the Rocksauce Studios Brand which we have cultivated.</p>

						<h1>v3 DESIGN</h1>
						<p>Even though the iconography was now where we wanted it, we didn't think the heavy colors behind each block accomplished the feeling we wanted.</p>
						<p>We attempted to play with an "off-set printing" style, that added life to the art, while allowing the design to breathe a little more.</p>

				<div class="screenshot right">

						<h1>FINAL DESIGN</h1>
						<p>Now that the design was open, we needed to get the treatment right. We chose a banded coloring style that created a distinctive & refined flavor.</p>
						<p>With the style defined, we moved UDID to the top-left, as it was knew it was the primary reason most users would download the app.</p>

				<h1>THE LOGO</h1>
				<p>Meta. It's not a concept that easily lends itself to a logo. Our approach was to keep everything very high-level, and move away from a literal translation. Something that went beyond a simple illustration of a phone or a standard icon.</p>

				<p>Meta is a concept that's hard to grasp. We created an optical illusion, combining the concepts of meta, data, and devices all into one M.C. Escher inspired logomark.</p>

				<h1>THE APP</h1>
				<p>Content is king. There's no reason to fill important information screens with unnecessary art. MetaSauce gets to the point, shows you what you want, and lets you export.</p>
